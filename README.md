# Hi there. I am Anna (Quoc Duyen Anh) Nguyen! 😁 

# ABOUT ME

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Business Analytics at San Jose State University and I will graduate in December 2022. My career interests are Business Analytics/Data Analytics. I enjoy working with data and I enjoy taking lessons on LinkedIn Learning to hone my technical and soft skills. It is my passion to discover patterns and meanings in data and figure out a way to bridge the gap between messy data and decision-making process. 

I frequently use my GitHub website to store school projects, any personal projects that I have worked on, and to update projects that I am currently working on as well. Thank you for visiting my website, if you have questions/feedback about my projects feel free to reach out to me. Stay tuned and enjoy!
