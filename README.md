# Hi there. I am Anna (Quoc Duyen Anh) Nguyen! 😁 

# ABOUT ME

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Business Analytics at San Jose State University and I will graduate in December 2022. My career interests are Business Analytics/Data Analytics. I enjoy working with data and I enjoy taking lessons on LinkedIn Learning to hone my technical and soft skills. It is my passion to discover patterns and meanings in data and figure out a way to bridge the gap between messy data and decision-making process. 

# My hobbies

😸 I love nature and animals

😸 I enjoy meeting people that come from different backgrounds and cultures, and closing the gap between us! 

😸 I have a passion for attaining the state of nirvana! 

😸 My dream goal is to travel the world and buy my own beach house to build a welcoming, lovely garden in the near future
